In DNA translation, we have steps to follow. main tasks constitute: 
  step 1: Manually download DNA and Protein Sequence data 
  step 2: importing DNA data into python 
  step 3: create an algorithm to translate the DNA 
  step 4: CHECK if translation matches your download

So, Our first task is to manually download DNA and protein sequence for this case study. The NCBI is the National Center for Biotechnology Information,
and it is United States' main public repository of DNA and related information. we will download two files from the NCBI. 

first file is Strand of DNA
and second file is Corresponding Protein Sequence

for that, lets GOOGLE NCBI and we will see the following site where we have to search for Neucleotide in the top search bar.     And in this field we need to enter a specific code that corresponds
 to the sample that we want to download.
 
    Here you need to be careful to type in exactly the following:
    capital N, capital M, underscore 207618.2.
    Once you have entered this exact string you can hit Search.
    If you did your search correctly you should see the same page
    that we have here up on the computer.
    This page contains a lot of information about this specific sample.
    We are primarily interested, first, in the DNA sequence.
    The DNA sequence is shown at the bottom of the page
    but the best way to download these data is the following:
    You can go to the very top of the page, you can click FASTA,
    and then you have the sequence here on the screen.
    You can then use your mouse and your cursor to highlight the sequence.
    Make sure you include the very first letter, which is G,
    and the very last letter, which is T. We can copy that,
    and then we go to our IDLE.
    here is the DNA sequence i have copied from the screen.

    I like to create a new file here so I just click New File.
    I then delete whatever happens to be on the screen.
    And the next step is to paste the DNA sequence into the editor.
    The next step for us is to save this DNA sequence.
    I have previously created a directory that I have called python_case_studies.
    I first go there.
    This case study is a translation case study
    so I will be selecting that folder.
    I want to call this file dna.txt, and I recommend
    you use that same file name convention.
    I then have to choose a dot txt in the menu
    here because we're saving a text file not a Python file.
    And if all goes well, you should now have dna.txt
    in your python_case_studies directory.
    Let's then go back from our sequence page, the main page for this sample.
    And to download the amino acid sequence you can click CDS.
    CDS stands for the coding sequence.
    If you look at the bottom right corner of your screen,
    you will see the translation here at the bottom of the pop-up window.
    I'm going to select that.
    Then I'll go back to my Python editor.
    I'll open a New File.
    I'll remove whatever is in this file, and then I will paste the amino acid
    sequence into the editor.
    I will then go to Save.
    I will then pick my previously created python_case_studies directory.
    I go to translation.
    And I'm going to call this file protein.txt.
    Again, it's a text file so I need to make
    sure I choose text file in the menu.
    And now we have downloaded both the DNA sequence and the protein sequence file.
    End of transcript. Skip to the start.
