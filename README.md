Simple case studies in python for research purpose
In this program, i ll be working on some basic use of python for research and calculations using some python packages

Some of the tasks include, 
- Use of random, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot modules with some fuctions relative to these modules
- DNA translation
* learning about the DNA neucleotides
* learn about the central dogma of molecular biology
    Tasks includes: 
    step 1: Manually download DNA and Protein Sequence data
    step 2: importing DNA data into python 
    step 3: create an algorithm to translate the DNA 
    step 4: CHECK if translation matches your download
